# Projects
# Data Analytics Using Python

Welcome to my Data Analytics project! Here, I basically analysed data.

## Project Overview
This project is my approach to solving complex computational problems using Python, optimized data structures, and algorithms. I also incorporated data visualization techniques and interactive Power BI dashboards to make the analysis more insightful and engaging.

## Features
- **Custom Python Application:** I developed this application to tackle complex data tasks using advanced data structures and algorithms.
- **Data Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I visualized data to reveal meaningful insights.
- **Power BI Dashboards:** I designed interactive Power BI dashboards for easy exploration and interpretation of project results.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization Tool:** Power BI
- **Core Concepts:** Data Structures, Algorithms

## Project Highlights
- Built custom algorithms in Python for handling large-scale data processing.
- Created data visualizations to make analytical insights accessible and engaging.
- Designed Power BI dashboards to interactively explore data and enhance data-driven decisions.



## Screenshots
